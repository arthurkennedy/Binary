/** RATIONALE
 * An axe is a pretty handy melee weapon and deals a fair amount of damage if the hit is well placed. The "accuracy" regarding an axe can be thought of
 * in terms of body location the axe hit when the person weilding the axe is under pressure and in close quarters with zombies:
 * 20% chance for full damage : 30 dmg (can decapitate common infected)
 * 70% chance for half damage : 15 dmg
 * 10% chance for no damage
 *
