/** RATIONALE
 * The Crowbar: the preferred weapon for particle physicists and zombie hunters alike. While handy in a pinch, a crowbar is blunt and not terribly well designed
 * for melee attacks. From the Half-Life wiki:
 * "If timed correctly, [hitting] can be repated until the zombie dies (usually around 5 hits)"
 * My proposed damage is a little more forgiving than Half-Life:
 * 20% chance for full damage : 10 dmg (kill common infected in 3 hits)
 * 70% chance for half damage : 5 dmg
 * 10% chance for no damage (either the person is really bad at swinging a crowbar or the zombie is out of range)
